        <p>     
            I've made up my mind <br>
            Don't need to think it over <br>
            If I'm wrong, I am right <br>
            Don't need to look no further <br>
            This ain't lust <br>
            I know this is love <br>
        </p>    
            
        <p> 
            But if I tell the world <br>
            I'll never say enough <br>
            'Cause it was not said to you <br>
            And that's exactly what I need to do <br>
            If I end up with you <br>
        </p>    
        
        <p>
            Should I give up? <br>
            Or should I just keep chasin' pavements <br>
            Even if it leads nowhere? <br>
            Or would it be a waste <br>
            Even if I knew my place? <br>
            Should I leave it there? <br>
            Should I give up? <br>
            Or should I just keep chasin' pavements <br>

        <p>
            I build myself up <br>
            And fly around in circles <br>
            Waitin' as my heart drops <br>
            And my back begins to tingle <br>
            Finally, could this be it <br>
